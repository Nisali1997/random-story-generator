                Isabella. They had a brave son named Prince Edward and a clever daughter named Princess Sophia.The kingdom of Emeraldia was

                thanks to the just and generous rule of King Arthur and Queen Isabella.One day, a fearsome dragon named Fang began terrorizing 
                the peaceful villages near the grand castle. The villagers were frightened and pleaded for help. Brave Prince Edward decided to 
                face the dragon. He wore his shiny armor, mounted his loyal horse, and rode out to the dragon's cave.When Prince Edward arrived, 
                he saw the huge dragon sleeping on a pile of golden treasure. Using his sharp sword, he fought the dragon with all his might. 
                The battle was intense, but Prince Edward's courage and skill helped him to defeat the dragon. The people of Emeraldia 
                celebrated Prince Edward's victory with a grand feast. The king and queen were proud of their son's bravery. Prince Edward and 
                Princess Sophia continued to help their parents rule the kingdom, ensuring that Emeraldia remained a happy and prosperous place 
                for all. And they all lived happily ever after.
